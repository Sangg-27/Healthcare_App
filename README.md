Medical Charges prediction is a machine learning based project where the medical charges of our clients is predicted using the ML Models.
This app aims to use four algorithms to measure the accurate value.

The algorithm used here are:
1. Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Random Forest Algorithm
4. Support Vector Machine

// Here 80% of the data has been trained and 20% of the data has been tested.
